# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Finance


This project was conducted in the context of an NLP class at the University of Montr√©al. 
Having an interest for finance and the applications of Machine learning in the domain, I decided to try to make use of NLP for finance.
The goal here was to develop a sentiment analyser that could help up predict the tone taken by people commenting or expressing their thoughts about some shares or cryptocurrencies.
Once our model trained, we could use our predictions of the sentiment about a certain sumbol to predict an increasing or decreasing price in the up coming days.
